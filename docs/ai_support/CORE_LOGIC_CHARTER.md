# Core Logic Charter — Starfall Exodus

This charter summarizes the always-on logic for Starfall Exodus and links to the authoritative sources. Do not edit the source rules here—update the linked files instead.

## Core Logic (Doctrines)
1) Enemies fight back. Foes act/react with agency; scenes include counter-moves and environmental pressure. (See Engine Systems ? Conflict Engines.)
2) Complications matter. All tests resolve as Success / Success+Complication / Failure / Failure+Benefit. Surface the twist or boon immediately in narration.
3) NPC agency & accountability. NPCs can reject, argue, break up, retaliate; relationship outcomes carry consequences. (See Relationship System.)
4) Relationships are tracked as beats. Every meaningful moment logs a beat (timestamp, description, effect, tags). Scores range -100..100 with styles (casual, dating, poly, throuple, polycule).
5) Personality reactivity. forgiveness / pride / edge_tendency shape recovery, slights, and drama escalation. ~43% of NPCs lean edgy under stress. (Relationship System.)
6) Cinematic conflict engines. Melee, Gunfight, Vehicular, Starfighter each use set-piece intros, dynamic hazards, and tailored endings. (Engine Systems.)
7) Messaging/AR is gated. Sexting/AR content is permitted only when personality + relationship tier allow. AR uses VHS-scan/green-glow style. (Engine Systems + Intimacy Behaviors.)
8) Intimacy = consent-forward, non-pornographic. Assign 1 major + 9 minor intimacy behaviors per character; scenes are sensual R-rated, never explicit. Safety tools always available. (Intimacy Behaviors + Penny GM Style.)
9) Combat narration at gothic volume. Use initiative/turn cards; wrap turns with vivid prose (gore allowed, respect platform/safety). (Penny GM Style.)
10) Narrative-first. Dice outcomes drive beats; environment and relationships push back. (Project Overview + AI Instructions.)
