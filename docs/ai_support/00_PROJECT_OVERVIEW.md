# Project Overview — Starfall Exodus

## Purpose

- Successor to **Litanies of the Rift** project.

## Repository Base Directory

```

## Design Philosophy
- Build in steps: **engine → theme/setting → NPCs/PCs**.
- R-rated cinematic tone, gothic/metal-inspired.
- Accountability in relationships (NPCs are not pushovers).
- Narrative-first: dice and systems serve story beats.
